Determine whether the hypothesis is true given the reference report. You should (1) Accept statements that paraphrase, visually describe, or are synonyms of findings in the report. (2) Reject only if the report contradicts or is silent about the finding. (3) Prefer clinical reasoning over string matching. For example, “mild cardiomegaly” implies “cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.”
